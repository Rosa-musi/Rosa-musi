### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Rosa and Iâ€™ve always loved to learn so one day I decided to take a dive into the sea of technology and here I am. I started with systems engineering, web development and bites of the cloud with Azure and GCP.

Before my technology interest I studied a career in music and I am currently violoncello teacher and also play in a contemporary chamber music group where I get fun with new composers, improvising and exploring with sounds, thatâ€™s why my musi of Rosa-musi.

Now Iâ€™m doing:

-	Studying **systems engendering**  (just started my specialization classes in block chain).
-	Making a **GCP course** with google cloud (looking for the certification).
-	**Laboratoria:** a whole new world to me where I could learn **web development**, soft skills and a lot more.


Iâ€™m learning:

-	GCP fundamentals.
-	HTML.
-	JavaScript.
-	CSS.
-	NodeJs.
-	React.
-	Git/GitHub.

I am looking forward to get my first job in technology and doing it with all the things that I am and now beside my technical knowledge.
