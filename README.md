About me

- Before my technology interest I studied a career in music and I am currently violoncello teacher and also play in a contemporary chamber music group where I get fun with new composers, improvising and exploring with sounds, that‚Äôs why my musi of Rosa-musi.
- I have two cats üêàüêà‚Äç
- I love to cook, all my friends know that to me doesn't exist "I don't have anything in the patry - fridge", there's always something, I always find the way to make the most with what I have on hand and love to watch their faces when the enjoy that weird sandwich or those improvised soups.
- One day I couldn't do a headstand in my yoga class, that day I promise myself that I'll do it one day and I ended taking a yoga certification because of it, by the way, I could reach the headstand.

I am looking forward to get my first job in technology and doing it with all the things that I am and now beside my technical knowledge.
